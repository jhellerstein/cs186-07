        Recommended Steps
        -----------------

o Read and understand the buffer manager code.

o Create your version of freelist.c (for the LRUreplacement policy) IN
  THIS DIRECTORY from freelist.skel.c.

o Test whether your freelist.c compiles properly and has 
  the correct logic by making use of the buftest.c code.
  The file buftest.c provides a sequence of pin/unpin
  operations and lets you observe how your buffer frames get 
  replaced using a small number of frames and disk blocks.
  You should change the sequence of pin/unpin operations
  in buftest.c and observe how your code manages the buffer 
  frames.

o Now that you are sure that your freelist.c is correct,
  its time to put them in the real PostgreSQL code and 
  perform experiments.  To apply your changes:
  $ cp freelist.c ~/Hw1/postgresql-8.0.3/src/backend/storage/buffer/freelist.c
  $ cd ~/Hw1/postgresql-8.0.3/
  $ gmake
  $ gmake install

o Use the scripts in ../PerformanceEvaluationScripts to create tables,
  load data and run queries.
