	Recommended Steps
	-----------------

o Read and understand the buffer manager code.

o Create your version of freelist.c
  (for the CLOCK replacement policy) IN THIS DIRECTORY.

o Test whether your freelist.c compiles properly and has 
  the correct logic by making use of the buftest.c code.
  The file buftest.c provides a sequence of pin/unpin
  operations and lets you observe how your buffer frames get 
  replaced using a small number of frames and disk blocks.
  You should change the sequence of pin/unpin operations
  in buftest.c and observe how your code manages the buffer 
  frames.

o Now that you are sure that your freelist.c is correct,
  its time to put them in the real PostgreSQL code and 
  perform experiments.

o Use update.sh to automatically copy freelist.c into 
  the right places in the PostgreSQL code. This will also
  compile your code with PostgreSQL.

o Use the scripts in ../PerformanceEvaluationScripts to create tables,
  load data and run the query. 

o Get the results and interpret them.
