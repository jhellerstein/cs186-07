To run the tests, make sure you have postmaster running (e.g., via
'pg_ctl start') and that you have run 'createdb' to generate a database.
Then, in this directory type: 

	% ./runme.sh

You will see a list of all tests that you failed.

Points were as follows:

    Buffer leak failure: 0.5 points
    Buffer lock failure: 0.5 points
    mmgr failure: 1 point
    Distance Function failure: 1 point
    One-Page failure: 1 point
    Near-Neighbor failure: 5 points
    Selection failure: 1 point

If your code did not compile, or crashed before executing any tests, you
did not receive any points.  If your code passed some tests and then
crashed, you received points for the tests you passed.

Note: During grading, the tests for One-Page, Near-Neighbor and
Selection were rerun manually with the geo_ops_master.c file; if you
did better with geo_ops_master.c you were given credit for those
tests.
